S-Metaheuristics for TSP
========================

This repository contains two solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
* [Simulated annealing](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/josemazo/s-metaheuristics-for-tsp/blob/master/tsp_simulated_annealing.ipynb)
* Tabu search (still working on it)

Refrences are inside each Notebook. TSP instance files are from the [University of Waterloo Mathematics Department](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/index.html).
